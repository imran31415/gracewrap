# Contributing to GraceWrap

We love your input! We want to make contributing to GraceWrap as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gracewrap.git
cd gracewrap

# Install development tools
make install-tools

# Run tests to make sure everything works
make test
```

### Code Style

- We use `gofmt` for formatting
- We use `golangci-lint` for linting
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Write tests for new functionality

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with race detector
make test-race

# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# Run full CI pipeline locally
make ci-test
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/imran31415/gracewrap/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/imran31415/gracewrap/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
